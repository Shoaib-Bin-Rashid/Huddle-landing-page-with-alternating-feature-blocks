## My process

Step by step process for building the project by completing html elements for the website then adding required css to design the website as required.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I discovered the use of adjusting all the elements to create the project as close as the orginal one.
I faced some issue with the floating card to adjust the position to the center.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
